# Devember-C-Roguelike
This repository will be adding a new commit everday with atleast one hour of coding each day.
Plan for this project is to create a textbased roguelike with probably ncruses library using C.

Solemn Swear
------------
I, Riku Kaipainen, will participate to the next Devember. 
My Devember will be creating a textbased roguelike on C.
I promise I will program for my Devember for at least an hour, every day of the next December.
I will also write a daily public devlog and will make the produced code publicly available on the internet.
No matter what, I will keep my promise. 

* I will try to create textbased roguelike console game using C
