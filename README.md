# Devember C++ Roguelike
This is a repository for a project where we aim to create a text based roguelike using c++.
We will be using PDCurses library to work with command prompt as our program display.

Solemn Swear
------------
We will participate to the next Devember. 
Our Devember will be creating a text based roguelike on C++.
I promise I will program for my Devember for at least an hour, every day of the next December.
I will also write a daily public devlog and will make the produced code publicly available on the internet.
No matter what, I will keep my promise. 

* We will try to create text based roguelike console game using C++
