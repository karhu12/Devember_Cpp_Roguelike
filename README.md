# Devember C++ Roguelike
This is a repository for a project where we aim to create a roguelike using c++.
We will be using PDCurses library to work with command prompt as our program display.

Solemn Swear
------------
We will participate to the next Devember. 
Our Devember will be creating a roguelike on C++.
I promise I will program for my Devember for at least an hour, every day of the next December.
I will also write a daily public devlog and will make the produced code publicly available on the internet.
No matter what, I will keep my promise. 

* We will try to create roguelike console game using C++
* Should have procedually generated maps
* RPG elements (npcs, overworld, etc.)

This day was spent mostly on getting started. We were checking out a few libraries we could use in this project.
Initially i got PDCurses library working even before this project started but we wanted to try out other librarys with more functionality.
We tried to get libtcod working on windows but it ended up wasting many hours of our time and we decided to just keep on using PDCurses.
Rest of the night i just researched what kind of functions does PDcurse have and tried some of them out.

This day got a little bit more productive. 
I started to get some foundation for functions and classes done. I improved the UI to actually look like game.
I created test player with some really simple movement and tried drawing game window with it successfully.
I need to implement better functions to do some repeating stuff.
I learned how to split classes and functions into headers and other source files.

Today i was able to create different kind of game functionality which should be used later on the code.
I created struct with games tileset. It includes tile names, types, colors and etc.
I also created a function that is able to determine which color pairs to apply when drawing game screen.
Also i divided the classes and functions yet more clearly to subfiles.
In general really productive and teaching day! :)
